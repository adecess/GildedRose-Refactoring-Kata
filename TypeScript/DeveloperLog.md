# Step 2

Cloned repository and navigated to the TypeScript folder.

# Step 3

Read README.md and followed instructions to be able to use the TextTest tool.

# Step 4

Extracted string literals into a common ItemName enum constants to make them clearer and easy to update.

# Step 5

Added constructor types and added missing ItemName constants.

# Step 6

Replaced the index-based for loop with a for...of statement to improve readability.

# Step 6

Extracted updateItem method from the for...of as a class method. It makes it easier to focus on each item modifications, as the name suggests.
